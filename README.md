# 16bitfilter
pixel filter based on 16bit sega mega drive/genesis
Always liked 16 bit graphics and at that time we had high hopes for VR. AR is an interesting  field to me and was talked abpout in sci fi novels I used to read. Ad hoc graphics  vs stored models. It basically has brighter colours due to a lower pallete and pixellates. I think I have to start with Google Cardboard eg. android and go from there.
